# Required Whitelist

To participate in any (or all) round of Squad Game, participants must go through the whitelisting process. Different participants will be receiving different instructions on how to get added into each whitelist. Beginning on October 12, whitelisting will begin for Calamari crowdloan participants only (other whitelists will come out at later dates, and will be announced later as well). Whitelisting for Calamari crowdloan participants will be open for a period of 5 days, ending on October 18.

?> Please note that many community members may be qualified under many of these categories. There is no advantage to signing up for multiple whitelists. At the end of the day, your identity must be verified, and can only be linked to one whitelist ticket.

- Calamari crowdloan participants who contributed through Polkadot JS should go to [preapprove.manta.network](https://preapprove.manta.network/) - from there, you can sign your KSM contribution address to prove that you are a participant in the Calamari crowdloan. If you qualify, you will be able to fill out your information. Please fill out the information and submit to be whitelisted. Only qualified Calamari crowdloan participants will be able to whitelist. A qualified Calamari crowdloan participant is:
    - Qualified for Round 1 if you contributed at least 0.5 KSM
    - Qualified for Round 2 if you contributed at least 0.2 KSM
