## Two Rounds for the Community

Squad Game is a community-exclusive, invite-only event offered in two distinct separate rounds. All participants of all rounds will be invited via email and must pass KYC to participate. The registration and KYC processing window opens on October 19 and will continue until November 9.

Round 1 is a guaranteed allocation and will be open for 24 hours starting November 10. Participants from round 1 are invited to also participate in round 2 that is first-come, first-served. Round 2 will open 5 hours after the close of round 1.

## Fairness for the Community: Grow the Squad
The goal of Squad Game is to reward and thank the Manta community members for their ongoing support throughout the Manta project development in the past, present, and future. Thus, Squad Game is designed to maximize the population of Manta token holders by enabling involvement for as many community participants as possible. As part of this initiative, we have decided on the following design:
1. Low maximums to deter single individuals or groups from taking too much of the token allocation.
2. Low minimums to allow community members to participate with smaller amounts.
3. Two rounds to maximize the amount of participation from the community.
