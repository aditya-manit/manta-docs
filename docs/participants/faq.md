## Whitelisting Questions


!>Why are qualified whitelisted crowdloaners required to have a minimum 0.2 KSM Calamari crowdloan contribution to qualify for Round 2?

?>Many crowdloan participants are attempting to create multiple accounts during the Calamari crowdloan, in order to receive multiple whitelist accounts. To address this exploit, we are implementing a strict minimum requirement for 0.2 KSM. 

!>Why are qualified whitelisted crowdloaners required to have a minimum 0.5 KSM Calamari crowdloan contribution to qualify for Round 1?

?>For the supporters who provided over 0.5 KSM in the Calamari crowdloan, we are offering an additional reward of being able to participate in Round 1, in order to demonstrate our appreciation for their support. 

!>I participated in the Calamari Crowdloan through multiple wallets, which are under 0.2 KSM. Can I still qualify?

?>No, only wallets that contributed over 0.2 KSM qualify.

!>I participated in the Calamari Crowdloan through a centralized exchange (e.g., Kucoin or Gate). How do I get preapproved?

?>If you participated through a centralized exchange, you don't have to worry about setting up pre-approval. Furthermore, while you have not received an invitation to participate in Squad Game, you may still be qualified. We do not have your email address because you did not sign up for our newsletter. The exchanges have your email address information. If you qualify for any of the rounds based on your Calamari Crowdloan contribution, the exchanges will share your email with us, and we will send you registration information in the upcoming days. This information has not been sent out yet to participants who contributed to the crowdloan through centralized exchanThe exchanges will send us the email information for all qualified crowdloan participants.

!>I'm an ambassador and I haven't received an email yet.

?>We have not sent an email to ambassadors yet. We have all our ambassadors' emails, so you don't have to worry about whitelisting. We will take care of that for you.

!>Why are participants in certain regions unable to participate?

?>Due to the regulatory environment and actions of certain countries, Manta Network is not allowing participation from citizens of those countries. While we want to encourage as much participation as possible, we need to be mindful of the laws and regulations.

!>The whitelisting method I'm trying to do isn't working. What can I do?

?>If you have tried to go through whitelisting but are still having issues with completing it, please send an email to tokensale-support@manta.network. Please be as descriptive as possible regarding your issue, and send screenshots if necessary.

!>If I qualify for multiple whitelists, can I apply to them all?

?>We understand that some of you may qualify for multiple whitelists (e.g., some people may be qualified as a Calamari crowdloaner and active ambassador). Applying to multiple whitelists will not provide you with any advantages. You only need to apply to one.

!>I was a member of Telegram or Discord but I was kicked out. Am I eligible for whitelisting?
Only active and participating members of our communities are eligible for whitelisting. If you were kicked or banned from our community, you are ineligible to participate in the event.
